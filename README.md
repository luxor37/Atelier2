# Atelier2

- In the main class of Trajectoire.java you can uncomment the appropriate line to run one of the question#() method (replace # by the appropriate number). You can also change the quality and fps setting on the same call to question#().
- Run Trajectoire.java to generate cameras.json (never commit cameras.json to git - gitignore).
- Then run Visu3d.jar in the same loction as cameras.json, the textures folder, scene.json and ffmpeg.exe to generate every image and then the video

Use an IDE to run the java program. Then use command line or, on windows, simply execute the Visu3d.jar to generate the video
